In this project, we were assigned the challenging task of developing an application to manage the shipment of 
essential items during a disaster. The primary goal was to efficiently track and deliver both non-perishable and
perishable products to affected areas. The implementation involved creating distinct classes to represent Items 
and Perishables, encapsulating the complexities of handling expiry dates for the latter.

The project proved to be a significant test of my programming skills, especially in the context of OOP244. 
Despite the initial struggle and the rigorous nature of the subject, I recognized the importance of hard work 
in mastering programming. Debugging techniques and adherence to rules became paramount, often requiring extended 
periods of brainstorming to unravel complex problems.

The semester had its share of personal challenges, including a mid-semester campus change. This upheaval impacted
my performance as personal issues overshadowed studies. However, with dedicated effort, I managed to overcome 
the hurdles. The alignment of teaching methods between both professors was fortunate, contributing to my overall
understanding.

Looking ahead to the final exam, I acknowledge the need for intense preparation over the remaining days. 
Despite the challenges, the experience of completing Milestone 5 was particularly demanding, involving the 
submission of six versions within a tight timeframe. I took the help of AI for debugging my code only as I only had one 
day to submit 4 parts of milestone 5 and I also had my Database course exam. In retrospect, the course has been 
both challenging and rewarding, and I am determined to conclude it successfully.
