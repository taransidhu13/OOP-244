Workshop 10 
//////////////////////////////////////////

In creating this workshop, we were instructed to create a module called "selection" housing two crucial function
templates for array handling. The first function, named select, dynamically allocates memory to form an array
of indices where a specified key is found in the given array. It systematically scans through the array, 
pinpoints instances of the key, and records their indices in a new array. The termination of the array with 
-1 neatly signals the end of the indices. The second function template, csvDisplaySelection, offers a user-friendly
 display of elements at specified indices as a comma-separated list. It efficiently checks for the validity of 
the indices array, ensuring proper formatting for a clear and concise output. Additionally, the code pays close
attention to memory management, preventing potential leaks by appropriately deallocating dynamically allocated 
memory within the select function. With thoughtful comments and adherence to naming conventions, 
the code aims for clarity, making it easy to understand and maintain.

As regards to milestone 5 version 1, I am still working on it as other courses exams are taking place side by side. 
Reflection for milestone 5 version 1 and 2 will be provided in the coming week.
