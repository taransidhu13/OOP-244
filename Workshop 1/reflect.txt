**Workshop Reflection**

During the completion of this workshop, I encountered a few challenges and learned several important concepts
related to file I/O and string manipulation.

One notable challenge was related to scanning the records from the data file. Initially, I faced some difficulties
in properly parsing and extracting the data from the tab-separated records. However, with the guidance of my 
professor, I was able to use the `sscanf` function (I couldn't do it with fscanf, a problem I am still seeking solution for)
effectively to parse the records and extract the required 
information, such as names, area codes, prefixes, and numbers.

Another challenge was converting both the user's input and the records from the file to lowercase for a
case-insensitive search. It required careful handling of character strings and the use of the `toLowerCaseAndCopy`
function from the `cStrTools` module. This step was crucial to ensure that the search worked as expected.

Overall, it took approximately two hours to write the entire code, but the effort was definitely worth it. 
Throughout this workshop, I learned about different string functions, their implementations, and refreshed 
my memory on concepts learned in previous courses like IPC144. The combination of C-style file I/O and C++-style
string manipulation allowed me to create a robust program for searching a phone directory, which was a valuable 
learning experience.
